## This is the second step to my animation template

- It is the follow up to this: https://github.com/AlexRz912/dynamic_letter_kata

- I'm looking for feedback, if you wish to do a code review, be my guest, I need to learn on performance optimisation and clean architecture.

## Code kata instructions

- Make letters come one by one to the screen with random character apparition prior to the character that is actually part of the text. It's an animation you often see in movies, which you can easily do using After Effects, but this time, no video format.

- Clone my repository and launch a server to see what happens in index.html

## why is it public

I'm now trying to put "Learn In Public" in practice, which I've heard for the first time on codewars :
